A data-driven machine learning solution to identify and flag **potentially fraudulent credit card transactions** in real time. This system leverages historical data to learn transaction behavior and accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activity.


## Objective

To develop an intelligent classification model that can accurately **detect fraudulent transactions**, thereby helping financial institutions minimize risk and financial losses.


## Key Deliverables

-  In-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA)
-  Comprehensive **data preprocessing** and **feature engineering**
-  Machine Learning model: **Logistic Regression**
-  Model evaluation with key metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)
-  Model export as `.pkl` for reuse
-  Custom script (`predict.py`) for predictions on new data
-  Dataset managed using **Git LFS**
